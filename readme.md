# Lesson 1

## Lession 1.1 - Start your 3D Engines

- Not a whole lot of new stuff here, if you're already somewhat familiar with the Unity editor and its controls etc.

## Lession 1.3 - High Speed Chase

- Not sure if this tutorial is right for me; going very slow, looking forward to the more unity-specific stuff...
- Helpful trick is to set the Playmode Tint Color (under Edit > Preferences) to a more distinct color (like #9DC2EF with alpha = 150) to get right away whether you are in edit or play mode.

### New Concepts & Skills
